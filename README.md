# Uneeq-Task1
This task builds a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to construct the neural network and fine-tunes the model parameters to maximize accuracy. The model's performance is measured through accuracy improvement strategies such as hyperparameter tuning.
